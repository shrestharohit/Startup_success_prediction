# Startup Success Prediction

This Project focuses on predicting the success of startups by analysing various key factors from the startups funded by Y Combinator. Y Combinator is a startup accelerator company .The dataset includes information of those companies funded by Y combinator . It includes the information about founders , the industries they belong to , the school they attended , and other relevant features. The main  bjective is to predict whether a startup will be acquired or fail based on historical data.
Four Machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes were evaluated using metrics like accuracy , precision , recall and f1 score. Random Forest and Gaussian Naive Bayes showed the most balanced performance among all , effectively predicting the success of startups.
According to the study, the chances of success are influenced by founders' education, industry and past experience.The experiment also showed that using machine learning to forecast startup results could be useful in making investment decisions for investors. T o increase the accuracy , future improvements can be done by using deeper models and larger dataset with more information.
